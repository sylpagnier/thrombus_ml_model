# Agent notes (HemoGINO)

## Biochem training progress

- Living log: [src/docs/BIOCHEM_TRAINING_PROGRESS.md](src/docs/BIOCHEM_TRAINING_PROGRESS.md)
- ~3h viscosity/velocity architecture sweep (per-leg teacher ckpts for viz): one line `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "…/scripts/go_visc3h.ps1"` → [scripts/go_visc3h.ps1](scripts/go_visc3h.ps1), [scripts/run_biochem_visc_velocity_arch_sweep_3h.ps1](scripts/run_biochem_visc_velocity_arch_sweep_3h.ps1) → `outputs/biochem/sweep_visc_velocity_3h/`
- Cursor rule: [.cursor/rules/biochem-training-progress.mdc](.cursor/rules/biochem-training-progress.mdc) — agents should update the log when the user discusses biochem teacher/corrector run results (unless they opt out).
- Run artifacts: `outputs/reports/training/biochem/<run_id>/run.jsonl` (compact `meta` / `val` / `end` events) and `outputs/reports/training/biochem/runs_index.jsonl` (one summary row per completed run). Val rows include **viz health** fields (`viz_health_score`, `viz_t0_speed_mean`, `viz_final_mu2_mean`, …) for rollout triage. Disable with `BIOCHEM_TRAINING_LOG=0`.
- Overnight health sweep: `scripts/go_health10h.ps1` (9 legs: **K0** Carreau kinematic probe first, then R0/G0/G1/S0/S1/M0/M1/M2) → `outputs/biochem/sweep_health_arch_10h/<leg>/biochem_teacher_best_high_mu.pth` (per-leg via `BIOCHEM_ARCHIVE_CHECKPOINT_DIR`).
- Teacher checkpoints: `biochem_teacher_best_high_mu.pth` (global best teacher by high-μ val), `biochem_teacher_last.pth` (latest run backup). Viz default: best high-μ teacher → last teacher. Optional legacy all-truth: `biochem_teacher_best.pth` if `BIOCHEM_TEACHER_KEEP_GLOBAL_BEST_ALL=1`.
